######### Internal Registers ###########
i0 - Holds 0 Constant
i1 - Holds 1 Constant
i2 - Free Register, use of "mov_imm2", which does opposite, moves reg into external
i3 - Holds Result of Cmp Operations AND mov_imm


######### Normal Registers ###########
r0
r1
r2
r3
r4
r5
r6
r7




Constraints
  Rtype - usually stores in first operand (3 bit, so more operations)
        - Try to use lower registers first (r0-r3)



Note:
  mov instruction - moves from first reg to second, so control unit is different
  mov_e
  mov_ei is mov_e switched, from internal reg to external (r1 to i1)
